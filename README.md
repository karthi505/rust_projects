# My Rust Projects ðŸ˜¼
## This Repository takes you through the journey of **MY** Rust <sub>shenanigans</sub>
### This Repository is what makes me want to learn More about Rust


- *All the Projects that i do(in Rust) are pushed here,that includes even the smallest,simplest projects(insight on what this repo may have)*
- **Why am i learning Rust?**.Because I Find The Concept of Ownership Unique and Wants to Learn more about it.
- **The Fact that Rust dosen't let you make/write unsafe code should help me write more better code is my theory ðŸ¤”**(might be wrong tho sometimes i think learning manual memory management might be more useful because it teaches you in the **Hard Way** )
